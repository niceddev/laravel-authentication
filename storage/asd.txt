Design patterns provide a reusable solution to the programming problems.
There are 3 types of design patterns: Creational, Structural and Behavioral.

Creational Patterns are used in object creation mechanisms, to create objects that can be decoupled from the system that implemented them.
For example какой нибудь один паттерн, например factory

next pattern is structural patterns. These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.



and behavior patterns are about managing algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects
